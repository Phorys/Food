## Stats:
Time to prepare: 30 minutes  
Serves: 4  
Combines well with: [Chili Sin Carne](https://phorys.github.io/Food/2022/06/27/Chili_Sin_Carne.html)

## Ingredients:
- Coconut Milk (400 ml)
- Water (3 dl)
- Salt (0.5 tsp)
- Basmati Rice (200 g)

## Method:
1. Add water, coconut milk and salt to a small/medium-sized pot.
2. Whisk the contents of the pot using a whisk. (To make sure the coconut milk mixes well.)
3. Bring the pot to a boil (If you leave a lid on, be careful it doesn't boil over, as it leaves quite a mess!) and add the rice. Once the rice are added, turn down the heat to a low temperature and leave it to boil WITHOUT a lid for about 20 minutes.
4. After the 20 minutes, remove the pot from the heat. If the liquid is gone, the rice are ready. If not, leave the rice off the heat for 5 minutes, to soak up the last liquid and then the rice are ready.
