A recipe to marinate halloumi and create a tasty meat alternative to wraps.

## Stats:
Time to prepare: 20 minutes  
Serves: 2  
Combines well with: [Guacamole](https://phorys.github.io/Food/2022/06/29/Guacamole.html)

## Ingredients:
- Halloumi Cheese (1 block (Around 200g))
- Honey (2 tbsp)
- Olive Oil (2 tbsp)
- Oregano (2-3 tsp)

## Method:
1. Add the honey, olive oil and oregano to a bowl and mix it well
2. Slice the halloumi into slices about 1 cm thick (A block should become around 6-8 slices)
3. Heat a frying pan (or a grill) - Additional oil on the pan is optional
4. Put the halloumi into the mixing bowl and flip it over one piece at a time and move it directly to the hot pan. (It can be a bit of a mess if you need to put it  aside)
5. Fry each piece of halloumi for about 2 minutes on both sides or until they turn a caramelized brown -> This browning happens very suddenly, so keep an eye on it. (If it turns a quite dark colour, it's still acceptable because it doesn't necessarily taste burned!)
