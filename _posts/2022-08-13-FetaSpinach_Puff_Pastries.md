Feta and spinach "piglets" for feta-loving people. (They also freeze really well!)

## Stats:
Time to prepare: 30 minutes  
Serves: 4  
Combines well with:

## Ingredients:
- Puff pastry-dough (2 sheets of around 20cm*35cm)
- Feta (1 block of 200 g)
- Spinach (50-100 g)

## Method:
1. Roll out the dough and place it on baking paper to be put in an oven pan later.
2. Cut each sheet of dough into about 6 equally sized cuts of about 6x10 cm.
3. Cut a block of feta into 12 equally-sized cuts of about 1x2x4 cm.
4. Layer each of the pastries with a bed of spinach (washed) and place a piece of feta from step 3 on top of the spinach on the lower half of the dough, with a little gap to the edge.
5. Fold over the pastry and use a fork to puch the open edges together.
6. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes on 200 degrees celsius.
