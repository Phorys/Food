When it's hot outside, it's important to stay hydrated and the watermelon salad is a great aid in this. (And I mean, it's watermelon!)

## Stats:
Time to prepare: 10 minutes  
Serves: 4  
Combines well with:

## Ingredients:
- Watermelon (1/2 pcs)
- Feta cheese (100-200 g)
- Leafy greens (100 g) - I prefer spinach, rocket or watercress. A combination is also fine, as long as it's leafy.

Optional:
- Red onion (1/2 pcs)
- Mint leaves (10-20 g)
- Balsamic vinegar (2 tbsp.)
- Pine nuts (25 g)



## Method:
1. Cut the watermelon into bite-sized chunks and add to a bowl.
2. Dice the feta into manageable dices and add to the bowl.
3. Add the leafy greens (washed) to the bowl (along with the red onions (thinly sliced), mint leaves (chopped) and balsamic vinegar)
4. Mix all of the ingredients well.
5. Roast the pine nuts on a dry, warm frying pan for a couple of seconds and add them to the bowl (Be aware that they will soak up the liquids, so if you plan to keep some of the salad in the fridge for the next day - The pine nuts could be kept in a small separate bowl to be added when served.)
