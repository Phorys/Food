A recipe for making blackberry jam.

## Stats:
Time to prepare: 90 minutes  
Serves: Plenty  
Combines well with:

## Ingredients:
- Blackberries (500 g)
- Caster Sugar (400 g)
- Lemon juice (1 tbsp)


## Method:
1. Rinse the berries and add them to a large bowl.
2. Mash or blend the blackberries. (I prefer blending as it makes it a lot easier to transfer the finished jam to a jar.)
3. Pour the blackberries into a large pot and heat them slowly until the berries are brought to a boil.
4. Add the sugar and lemon juice and leave it to boil for at least 30 minutes - Stir every ten minutes.
5. While the jam is cooking, prepare some jam glasses by cleaning them and rinsing them. Once rinsed, fill each of them with boiling water and leave them until the jam is ready.
6. Once the jam is ready, pour out the water from a jam glass and use a funnel and a soup spoon to pour the jam directly into the glass. Immediately close the lid on the glass and leave it on the counter to cool.
7. After all glasses are filled, leave them on the counter and wait for them to cool. At some point each glass should make a significant a pop-sound as the glass makes an airtight seal. Afterwards they can be stored in a fridge.
8. If a glass does not make a seal, this glass should be eaten first. When eating the jam, make sure to check it for mold. In my experience the jam should last for at least 1 year if stored in the fridge with an airtight seal.
