A recipe for classic danish Christmas pudding.

## Stats:
Time to prepare: 90 minutes  
Serves: 4 people  
Combines well with:

## Ingredients:
- Semi-skimmed milk (500 ml)
- Porridge rice (0.75 dl)
- Double cream (4 dl)
- Vanilla (1/2 pod)
- Almonds (25 g - 75 g)
- Caster sugar (1-2 tbsp)

## Optional:
- Vanilla sugar to taste
- Cherry sauce (Or another sweet type of jam-like sauce)

## Method:
1. Add rice, milk og vanilla (Take out the seeds from the pod and add seeds and pod to the pot) Boil them together at a low heat till they become rice porridge. The state of rice porridge is achieved the minute the rice sticks to the spoon and can only get off the spoon by banging it against the edge of the pot. (Stir frequently with a wooden spoon, because it burns very easily.)
2. Remove the vanilla pod. Cool the porridge, either at room temperature or in the fridge. Stir with a fork from time to time to loosen the rice. (Once or twice should be enough.)
3. Remove the almond shells, by putting them in boiling water for 1-2 minutes. Strain them out and let them cool. Afterwards the sheels can be removed bu pressing them out of their skins. (Beware that they might be very lively!) Blend the almonds, leaving them a little chunky and then add the almonds and the sugar to the cold porridge and stir with a fork till it has been mixed well.
4. Whisk the double cream till it becomes "soft peaks" and mix it into the porridge. (Sort of just added the porridge a spoonful at a time, while stirring the whipped cream with a fork.)
5. Adjust taste with vanilla sugar or sugar.
6. Keep in the fridge.
7. Heat cherry sauce and add just before serving.
